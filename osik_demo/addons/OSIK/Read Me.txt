This tool is completely free to use, modify, and include in your own projects.

üß© Installation

Copy the entire OSIK folder into your Godot 4.5 (or later) project.

When adding a new node, you‚Äôll see OSIK in the node list, select it just like any other node.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

The OSIK Node must be a child of the Skeleton3D node you wish to modify.

The Target can be any node in your scene, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a child of the skeleton or OSIK node.

If you make changes to the OSIK script, set the Active property to Off before editing to prevent errors.

Scaling is not currently supported. Keep your scale at Vector3(1, 1, 1) to avoid unexpected results.

Works best with clean, properly oriented skeleton hierarchies.
